### -Used Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting to predict classes of a synthetic dataset and the MNIST Dataset.
### -Acheived 100% test accuracy on the synthetic dataset using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
### -Acheived 96% test accuracy on the MNIST Dataset using Bagging, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
